# wdi-project-1
My first project for WDI in London
Introduction


Color game is a one player game designed to help kids learn their colours .  This will be the first project that i have built at the Web Immersive course at General Assembly in London. A hosted version of Colour Game can be found [here] ( https://desolate-forest-29347.herokuapp.com).


How to play

Upon loading the site the player will be presented with a grid with numbers. When the player is ready to start they must click on the  start button below the heading Colour Game. Once this is clicked the game and timer will begin.

The aim of the game is to read the colour that is in the center tile.  Then within the allotted time, the user must key press the corresponding numbers to the colours that are in the boxes. the timer begins with 10 seconds.  this will decrease by 2 seconds every round.  Good Luck!
